Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is a science that entails the systematic designing,developing,testing and maintaining software.
development of high quality software with enhanced user experience hence ensures that it meets the tailored purpose and systems that use the software run efficiently.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.the birth of software engineering 1968 at NATO conference
2.introduction of object oriented programming-introduction of concepts nlike classes,objects,inheritance improved modularity,reusability maintainability
3.agile methodology with focus on flexibility,iterative development and stakeholder collaboration providing enhance efficiency and adptability in software development
4.advent of open ai first well furnished ai model 2022 that could generate code


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning-project scope objectives feasibility resources timelines potential risks and importance
2.requirements analysis-should meet requirements of stakeholders
3.design-architecture of software inluding system interface and data models
4development-code based on requirements and specifications
5.testing-anaylse code to find deffects and rectify
6.deployment-release of software to end users
7.maintenance-fix upcoming issues,updates and further optimization


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1.agile is more flexible to abrupt changes by utilisation of loops while waterfall is rigid as it relies on upfront planning and changes may result in immense rework.
2.waterfall is based on documentation to a predetermined end goal while agile based on working program and not necessarily documentation.
3.testing is a distinct phase in waterfall while in agile testing occurs continuously through out
4.agile invilves stakeholder from the beginning till the end in software development thus accommodative to change  while waterfall involves stakeholders early posibly for budgetting and planning and at the end for deployment.

waterfall can be used for development of aircraft as it is capital intensive and relies on experiments
agile can be used to develop social media app as it depends on feedback


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a software developer
designing developing and maintaining software and through collaborations with other developers and stakeholders understand requrements and deliver solutions through software optimistion,adding new features and debugging.

quality assurance 
develop and execute test plans and case scenarios and document and track issues about the software to ensure that the software meet quality standards and meet user needs and has a smooth user experience.

project manager
oversee development of software by coordinating and communicating with team member,planning timelines and budgeting resources,identification and risk mitigation and facilitation of collaboration and communication to achieve project goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development environment eg vscode studio and pycharm(python ide)
1.efficient as they offer code editers,debuggers,and compillers in a single program.
2.high code quality as theres is real time error detection.

version control systems eg git
1.enhace collaboration between developers as the can work on one project simultaneously without overwriting each others changes.
2.history tracking of all changes made to the codebase enabling the developers to revert to previous changes.
3.backup for code incase of deletion or corruption



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.time constraints and tight deadlines leading to substandard work-effective time management and adherance to time schedule and having realistic timelines.
2.limited resources which may stall projects tackled with using cost efective solutions and clearly communicating with stakeholder to provide realistic support.
3.security threats and data theft-follow secure coding standards and conduct regular security audits
4.balancing innovation and stability-new features are nice but not at the expence of function;thorough testing and making small but managable updates a safer way to go.
5. requirement volatility-frequent changes within the project may cause confusion and rework so good communication and use of agile methodologies to adapt to changes.
6. rapid advancements in technology is managed by continuous learning and networking

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing-tests different modules of software application individually separately
important in 1.early bug detection in software development
             2.ensures each part of code functions correctly
             3.facilitates debugging and maintenance 
             
integration testing- tests interaction between intergrated units/modules.
important in 1.identify issues in interaction between affected modules
             2.Ensures that combined parts of the application work together as expected
             3.early detection of integration issues
             
system testing-tests the complete software system;all modules
             1.ensure systems meet the specified requirements
             2.identify issues that were not detected in unit or integration testing

acceptance testing-evaluate system compliance with the intended purpose and whether it is ready for delivery
                  1.ensure thet the customer satisfaction is met
                  2.avoid post release issues



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is the science of interacting with AI models where giving clear consise specific instructions results in the model giving specific answers.
it helps train the ai models on how to respond to questions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

tell me about software development-this prompt may produce information with tough terminologies that may not be understandale to a common man
tell me about software development like someone new to tech-my give simplified information
